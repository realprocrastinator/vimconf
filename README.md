# vim configuration
Personal configuration for both vim and neovim.
Save this file to `#HOME/.vimrc` for vim user or to `#HOME/.config/nvim/init.vim` for neovim user. This configuration requires *Vundle* for plug-in management, once you have *Vundle* installed, you can run `:PluginInstall` to install all the plugins. Enjoy ;).
